IPbus firmware
==============

The IPbus protocol is a simple packet-based control protocol for reading and modifying memory-mapped resources within FPGA-based IP-aware hardware devices which have a virtual A32/D32 bus.

The IPbus suite of software and firmware implement a reliable high-performance control link for particle physics electronics, based on the IPbus protocol. This suite has successfully replaced VME control in several large projects, and consists of the following components:

**IPbus firmware**
  A module that implements the IPbus protocol within end-user hardware.

**ControlHub**
  A software application that mediates simultaneous hardware access from multiple uHAL clients, and implements the IPbus reliability mechanism over UDP

**uHAL** 
  The Hardware Access Library (HAL) providing an end-user C++/Python API for IPbus reads, writes and RMW (read-modify-write) transactions.

This repository contains a reference implementation for an IPbus 2.0 UDP server. It has been extensively tested on several different boards within several particle physics experiments. However, it is supported on a best-effort basis, and is provided on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
